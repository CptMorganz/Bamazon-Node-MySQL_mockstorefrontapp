## A Node and MySQL mock Amazon-like storfront application.

Uses Node to interact with a MySQL database to offer a list of items for customers to choose to purchase and how many they wish to purchase of that item.

It then checks the database to see if the item selected was listed and if there is enough in stock to sell to the customer.
